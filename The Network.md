Scriptures are from the English Standard Version (ESV)

Acts 2:42-47

The Fellowship of the Believers  
42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. 43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common. 45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. 46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.


Hebrews 10:24-25

24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near. 


 Ecclesiastes 4:9-12
 
9 Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their toil. 10 For if they fall, one will lift up his fellow. But woe to him who is alone when he falls and has not another to lift him up! 11 Again, if two lie together, they keep warm, but how can one keep warm alone? 12 And though a man might prevail against one who is alone, two will withstand himâ€”a threefold cord is not quickly broken.


John 15:4-5

4 Abide in me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in me. 5 I am the vine; you are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing. 




The Network is God Designed

* The new church is formed the day of Pentecost
	* The new Christians are not just given programs but true fellowship; koinonia that requires Partnership, Participation, and Benefaction.
	* They are taught to share everything, care for one another, pray for one another.
	* This is was a natural outflow of the Spirit.
* The Spirit that saves, is the same Spirit that builds community in Christ.

The Counterfeit Network

* There is a surge in faith-based technology.
* At the same time that people are turning away from the church, more people are turning to AI
	* Priest
	* Counselor
* Some religious leaders support the use of these technologies as a supplement while others have concerns over the potential to replace human interaction.
* While AI can give you Participation and a degree of Benefaction, it can not give you true Partnership and is, therefore, counterfeit fellowship.

Rebuilding the True Network

- **Reconnect** by committing to regular fellowship, not just Sunday attendance.
- **Intercede** by creating an atmosphere where people are look to prayer as the first response, not the last resort.
- **Disciple**.  We have to make facetime for our youth and young adults.  Invite them to "log out" of counterfeit networks and into the body of Christ.
